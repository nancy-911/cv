            I am a Billionaire Investor aged 21, founder of BChainSolutions, a
            Blockchain-powered company. I am a petrolhead, I love bikes and cars and
            my biggest love is exploring the world and doing adventurous sports.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I have not been a very good supporter of Formal Education.</li>
      <li>
        I failed through the entire 3 years of my college and I don't hold any
        valid degree.
      </li>
      <li>
        Formal education is not at all necessary to make it big in life (In my
        case, it is an absolute waste of time).
      </li>
      <li>
        However, I am an avid believer in self-education, and I love reading and
        learning something new everyday.
      </li>
      <li>
        I self-taught myself coding and established a multi-billion dollar
        business based on Blockchain technology.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>

        about 10 supercars. I am a professional racer as well.
